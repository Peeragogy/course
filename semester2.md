# Peeragogy Course - Semester Two - Spring 2020 - Syllabus

## About

In this course peers will work together to design new ways to address the global demand for learning opportunities. Our primary textbook will be the Peeragogy Handbook (currently in a 3rd edition). Participants will contribute to critical review, expository writing, media production, and creative design. One outcome would be a collaboratively produced Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) based on the course materials. During the course, we will design and develop additional innovative interventions. Peer learning will be practiced throughout, by tailoring the syllabus, developing new ways of processing and presenting the course material, through supportive peer feedback, and in collaborative final projects. 

In our interactions we will try to follow [community guidelines](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/peeragogy/crcPDvxVwjk/yitDNV5iBQAJ). The guidelines themselves are a work in progress so they may be updated.

### Session Four - April 23rd

#### What We Did

_Taken from Hermano's [Google Doc Notes Peeragogy Semester 2 session](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_nxrVj1CvBtBR9zbQhmQxRBjj7-VKDUQcYzbyMOaoRo/edit)_

Chuck did a summary of what has happened in prior sessions

Participants made personal presentations: which have ranged from papers, readings, project of their own

Hermano has pointed to the Amazon experience which is presented 

Joe has proposed that we share personal practices and projects relating them to peeragogy

Vitor commented on his presentation "leaders of learning" of the last session which follows the track proposed by Joe.

Joe believes short presentations are a great format for sharing.

Vitor shared this presentation about the business model canvas
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gbx0NLgCBkpAACSTJRZWUa0P_eras0EN6US_TF6Zlbc/edit?usp=sharing

Joe suggested that Hermano could present his practice with peeragogy using Google docs on a startup accelerator program he runs.

Hermano participated in Howard’s course in 2010 but has met him in 1998 on his Brainstorms virtual Community and it was really amazing

Howard couldn’t read his PhD because it was in portuguese, but he has read his introduction and  his thank you to him as his thoughts originated the research. His thesis dealt with cooperation observing the open source development communities.

Hermano present:
Cooperation, more theoretical
Practice within incubator - more practical
How to cooperate in virtual environments, beyond Zoom - fresh and much of the material is in English
Travelend between many documents to show how open source community cooperates. People work asynchronously. Digital collaboration doesn’t need to be synchronous. Should be extended through many toosl

Chuck has chosen the second option

Possible project - connect up different KeyBase, Hangouts, WhatsApp

Future presenters
Hermano will present on digital collaboration - April 30th
Joe could present about founders and coders - May 14th

We could also invite Howard as a future presenter

Hermano will attach this document to GitHub


##### Proposed Agenda Before Session Started

What do you think of this as an agenda? Are there any changes you would like? Also I shared the agenda for week 4 of the pilot course. Do we want to incorporate any of that?

1. Introductions and discuss how everyone is doing
2. Everyone choose a Rheingoldian role to play below in the meeting
3. Review this document
4. Do people want to choose readings to present?
5. Do people want to have any guest speakers join upcoming sessions?
6. Do people want to incorporate one of their current projects to see if we could accelerate it?
7. Open

###### Materials for week 4 from Pilot Course
Develop a networking strategy: Who else should we involve in our learning? We will start reaching out to other people to co-design final outcomes for the class. We will review the "Data Fair" from Data Science for Design as one way to organize such outreach, and discuss which methods will work best for us. For example, students may experiment with uploading text to Wikipedia and engage in discussions there.

### Session Five - April 30th

##### What happened
- Hermano gave an amazing presentation about digital collaboration in online communities with examples spanning from the 1980s to now

##### Agenda Before
- Hearmano present about how to cooperate in virtual environments

### Session Six - May 7th

##### What happened

We followed-up on our discussion from session two where Vitor suggested creating a presentation to make it easier for newcomers to get up to speed. This led to Vitor and Hermano sharing their experiences learning about the project. We concluded by talking about having Vitor and Hermano join us in working on our current paper.

##### Proposed Agenda before session started

1. Introductions and discuss how everyone is doing
2. Review this agenda
3. Decide what we will use for notes: zoom chat, Google Doc, other
4. Everyone choose a Rheingoldian role to play below in the meeting
5. Do people want to have any guest speakers join upcoming sessions?
6. Do people want to incorporate one of their current projects to see if we could accelerate it? (e.g., presentation, paper, handbook, business model canvas, etc.)
7. Open

### Session Seven - May 14th

#### Ray's wrap

1. Since not everyone had met everyone else yet, we had several introductions.  This led to new perspectives and richer discussion.
2. The main topic on the agenda was the paper for the upcoming anticipation conference.  We didn't edit the documents much, but we did go over them and discussed them.
3. We don't want to assume that everyone or even most the intended audience of that paper is familiar with pattern and pattern languages.  From the last conference, it became apparent that a large part of the audience consists of designers but they didn't seem to say all that much about pattern languages.  Thus, we should be careful in what we assume of readers and take care to define and explain our notions.
4.  We should be sure to include non-western persprctives on pattern theory.  One noteworthy instance is the work of Takashi Iba and his group.
5.  We discussed how these topics of anticipating the future and pattern languages relate to peeragogy.

#### Proposed Agenda

1. Check-in and discuss how everyone is doing
2. Review this agenda
3. We will use zoom chat for notes
4. Everyone choose a Rheingoldian role to play below in the meeting
6. Anticipation paper
7. Peeragogy event
8. Open

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, peers will be able to synthesize interventions relevant to global economic challenges. They will gain design and media production skills relevant to creating a Massive Open Online Course. It is expected that peers will also train the affective dimensions of their engagement with difficult issues, by practicing rigorous self-assessment and developing constructive feedback for their peers. Specifically, peers successfully completing the course will build a portfolio of evidence that they can receive major challenges with compassion, respond with an awareness of diverse needs, value others’ perspectives and voices, organize effective networks and strategies, and characterize constructive collaborative efforts and ways to support them.

## Editorial Roles for the Handbook

If people in the course would like eventually to contribute to the Handbook, here are some possible roles and the license to sign is below.

### Management
That includes chasing people who have promised chapters.

### Content
Another major task that we had slated is to produce more activities and mini-handbooks.  A related task is an increasing “patternization” of the content. Some of the old chapters can be shortened and turned into new design patterns or short narrative sidebars.

### Direction
The comments generated in the Augment  reading group which will conclude on Tuesday give lots of hints about possible changes and improvements. Particular attention should be given to the introductory chapters.
- minihandbook: check practicality

### Technical
Then there is the technical editing, and getting everything to look nice. We had discussed possibly involving a professional designer, but it doesn’t look like we have the funds to pay anyone.

### Operations
Another relevant role is running and facilitating meetings.  It is pretty remarkable that we have been having meetings in this project almost weekly since 2012!   Assuming we keep up that pace on the way to publication we are talking about approximately 24 production meetings in the first half of next year.

### Marketing
Another task that we have kind of fallen down on in the past is marketing the book. I think that in recognition of the tremendous amount of effort that everyone has been putting into this, we should step up our game in this regard for the fourth edition.
